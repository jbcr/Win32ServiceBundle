```

# Define the runner

For each service, add a sub-class of `Win32Service\Model\AbstractServiceRunner`.
The sub-class must be configured in service with the tag `win32service.runner` with an alias name corresponding to the `service_id`.

## Exemple with one thread

Extension configuration:

```yaml
win32_service:
    windows_local_encoding: ISO-8859-1
    services:
      -
        service_id: "my_service"
        displayed_name: "My beautiful service"
        #[...]
```


Sub-class:

```php
class MyRunner extends \Win32Service\Model\AbstractServiceRunner
{}
```

Service configuration :

```yaml
services:
    MyRunner:
      tags:
        - { name: win32service.runner, alias: 'my_service'}
```

## Exemple with many thread

Extension configuration:

```yaml
win32_service:
    windows_local_encoding: ISO-8859-1
    services:
      -
        service_id: "my_service_%d"
        displayed_name: "My beautiful service"
        thread_count: 3
        #[...]

```


Sub-class:

```php

class MyRunner extends \Win32Service\Model\AbstractServiceRunner
{}

```

Service configuration :

```yaml
services:
    MyRunner:
      tags:
        - { name: win32service.runner, alias: 'my_service_%d'}
```

# Manage the service

Open an administrator cmd window and go to your project.

## Register the service

For register all service, run this command:

```bash
php bin\console win32service:register
```

For register only one service (without thread number) run:

```bash
php bin\console win32service:register --service-name=my_service
```
For register only one service (with thread number) run:

```bash
php bin\console win32service:register --service-name=my_service_%d
```

## Unregister the service

For unregister all service, run this command:

```bash
php bin\console win32service:unregister
```

For unregister only one service (without thread number) run:

```bash
php bin\console win32service:unregister --service-name=my_service
```

For unregister only one service (with thread number) run:

```bash
php bin\console win32service:unregister --service-name=my_service_%d
```


## Sent action at your services

This command start all service (and all thread) defined in your project.

```bash
php bin\console win32service:action start
```

For sent the action for one service and all thread:

```bash
php bin\console win32service:action start --service-name=my_service_%d
```

For sent the action for one thread of one service (work same if the service has only one thread):

```bash
php bin\console win32service:action start --service-name=my_service_1
```
